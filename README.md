Jump your way from platform to platform to slowly gather wood to build a tent and escape the ever increasing heat wave. Do all of this while dodging crocodiles in the water and a nasty kangaroo on land. Gathering fish can help you to score extra points. Try to beat your highscore by playing singleplayer or play with a friend to see who can escape first. You must escape into the tent before the temperature reaches 50 degrees Celcius in order to beat the game!
